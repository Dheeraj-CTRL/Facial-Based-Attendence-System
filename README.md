# Facial-Based-Attendence-System
A Python-based facial recognition attendance system automates tracking by detecting and matching student faces from provided images. 
It checks scheduled students per the timetable, marks attendance upon recognition, and 
logs it in an Excel sheet. This system simplifies attendance, reduces errors, and keeps records organized.
